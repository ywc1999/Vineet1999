   <h3 style="color:yellow;"><b>Hey</b>, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
 Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.
 Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description.
 I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.
 I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life (except STUDIES).
 There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
 I like to think, I like to dream;
 I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face,
 I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind,
 I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
 I like snow in winter.
 I like to sleep late, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I don't like to be surrounded by people.
 I like countryâ€™s peace, I like metropolisâ€™ noise; I like delicious food and comfortable shoes;
 I like cartoons, web series and comedy movies and I like to laugh.
 I am 21 years old. I am from Varanasi, India.
 I study B.C.A. at the R.S.M.T..
  I can speak two languages English and Hindi.
  I have two brothers. My dad is a serviceman in A.A.I. and my mom is a housewife.
   In my free time I like to play cricket and do cycling.
 This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more,
 then contact me or take a look at my pictures. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.</h3>
